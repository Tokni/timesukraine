# Conclusions
The application of economics and mathematical methods and models in the fields of strategic energy planning allows making not only qualitative but also quantitative assessment of the introduced or planned policies.

The achievement of the targets set in ESU2035 depends in many ways on the socio-economic development of Ukraine.

There is some uncertainty in the ESU2035 about the development of the energy system for the long-term future up to 2050, in particular with regard to the development of nuclear energy. In the case of the permanent attainment of goals of the ESU2035, the construction of a new block (#3) at the Khmelnitsky NPP for domestic needs of Ukraine is redundant in 2025, while it can be feasible by 2030-2035 from a socio-economic perspective

Even under the moderate growth scenario of wind and solar (according to Ukrenergo, 2018), the total share of renewables in 2035 may reach 31%, which is more than currently foreseen by the ESU2035. The underutilisation of feasible potential of renewables after 2035 will force the use of more expensive thermal generation, which will significantly increase the total cost of the system.

Today's "green-coal paradox" can be addressed using modern balancing technologies and demand management, allowing for more rapid and reliable growth of renewable energy.

Simultaneous compliance with the goals of the ESU2035 and other national strategies will require additional investment. However, this will have a synergistic effect in terms of higher efficiencies in achieving targets and an overall lower system cost. The modelling results indicate that there is a potential for improving the procedures for harmonization of sectoral policies and the need to update the indicators of the ESU2035.

In order to achieve significantly more ambitious targets for the decarbonisation of the economy (Low Carbon Scenario), it is necessary to extend the relevant ESU2035 policies beyond 2035. Otherwise, the relaxation or complete abandoning of the decarbonisation of the energy system can quickly offset the achievements, i.e. the reduction of the energy intensity of the economy, as well GHG and other emissions.
