# Assumptions

The database of the TIMES-Ukraine model includes the following data:
- statistical observations of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine
- data of the Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry; Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of regional development, construction and housing and communal services, SAEE, power generating and supply companies, etc.
- data from the IEA (in particular ETP, E-TechDS), DIW Berlin, IAEA, OECD, DEA and others (used to identify promising energy technologies and their technical and economic characteristics)
- data from specialised associations (Bioenergy Association of Ukraine, Ukrainian Wind Energy Association, Ukrainian Association of Renewable Energy Sources and other) and companies (Energoatom, Ukrenergo, DTEK, Naftogaz, etc.)
- the structure of demand in the end-use sectors (corresponding to the models structure of other European countries)
- long-term macroeconomic development indicators that are based on data from the IEF NASU, international financial, rating agencies and other organizations (IMF, World Bank, Standard & Poor's, etc.), as well as data of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade
- forecast of prices for the main energy resources (based on World Bank data)
- forecasts of demographic dynamics in Ukraine (based on data from the Institute of Demography and Social Research of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations)
- GHG emission factors (based on the National Inventories data on anthropogenic emissions from sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in Ukraine)

The basic macroeconomic scenario used in this project was prepared by the Institute for Economics and Forecasting in 2016 within the framework of the USAID project "Municipal Energy Reform in Ukraine". It has been updated with the recent changes in the economy of Ukraine. The macroeconomic scenario is shown in Table 1.

The forecast of prices for the main energy resources for Ukraine until 2050 is based on World Bank forecasts to 2030 [^2] (see Table 2). By extrapolating data, a corresponding forecast for 2035-2050 prices was made.

Population projections for 2020-2050 (Table 3) are based on the Institute of Demography and Social Research of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (IDSR), which are in line with the projections of the UN Department of Social and Economic Affairs (UN DSEA). For the purposes of this project, only one demographic scenario (IDSR – Scenario CCC) was used, which predicts average birth rates, average life expectancy and average net migration in Ukraine.
