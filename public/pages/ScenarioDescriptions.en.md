# Scenario Descriptions

Within the framework of this project, four scenarios (_Frozen Policy scenario_, _Reference scenario_, _National Strategy scenario_, _Low Carbon Society scenario_) and a set of sensitivity scenarios designed as variations on the Reference scenario have been developed. The Matrix of the modelling scenarios is shown  in Table 1.

Table 1. The Matrix of Scenarios

**_Frozen Policy scenario_** – assumes no changes in energy policy after 2015 (i.e. before adoption of the ESU2035). This scenario was made for comparison purposes.

**_Reference scenario_** – defined based on the main objectives and indicators of the Energy Strategy of Ukraine till 2035: reduction of the energy intensity of GDP; growth in the share of renewables in TPES; electricity generation structure, that preserves the dominant role of nuclear power as well as building unit #3 at Khmelnytska Nuclear Power Plant (KhNPP); and achieving European environmental requirements of the operation of large combustion plants. The same goals and restrictions are used for the period 2036-2050 (i.e. after ESU2035) as in 2035.

**_Sensitivity scenarios_** – are based on the Reference scenario and differ only in one of the constraints or conditions. In particular, opportunities to use new balancing capacity, availability of quality power generation forecasting system for Solar and Wind, or delayed construction of KhNPP unit #3 or renewable energy (according to the terms of the scenario presented in the Report on conformity assessment (adequacy) generating capacities (SE "NEC "Ukrenergo"). This group of scenarios was especially directed towards the needs of the Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry. The Matrix of the Sensitivity scenarios is presented in Table 2.

**_National Strategies scenario_** – includes targets from other national strategies and plans in addition to the conditions and constraints of the Reference Scenario, including Low Emission Development Strategies in Ukraine till 2050, the National Transport Strategy till 2030, Concept of state policy in the field of heating supply and others.

**_Low-Carbon Society scenario_** – aims at reducing the greenhouse gas emissions by 80% in 2050 with respect to 1990 levels. This scenario is closer to the climate mitigation policy adopted in the EU.
