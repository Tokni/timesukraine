# About
TIMES-Ukraine is a linear optimisation energy system model, belonging to the MARKAL/TIMES model family [^8]
[^9]
, which provides a technology-rich representation of the energy system (bottom-up framework) for the estimation of the energy dynamics in the long-run [^6]
. The Ukrainian energy system is divided into seven sectors in the model (Figure below). As such, the structure of the TIMES-Ukraine model complies with methodological approach of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine [^10]
 (harmonized with Eurostat and IEA methodology) on energy statistics, with more than 1.6 thousand technologies currently represented.

Prior to the project, the model database was populated with economic and energy statistics for 2005-2012, and the model was fully calibrated for the years 2005, 2009 and 2012 (except for parametrisation of processes, other model parameters were also properly estimated in order to reflect the energy balance; as such, any of these years could be used as a base year for calculations). Within the project, the model database was fully populated with data for 2013-2015, which made it possible to revise the parametrisation of energy technologies. Moreover, some key input data such as energy production, international trade, performance of power plants and boilers was also provided for 2016-2018. Although the model was not fully calibrated with a new base year (2015), the accuracy of the calculated energy balance for 2015 comparing to the reported document is quite high. The calibration (to 2015) can be performed with relatively moderate efforts, as no additional input data would be required.

Industrial users are further disaggregated into two categories depending on the level of energy intensity. Energy-intensive subsectors are represented by product-specific technologies. For other industrial subsectors, a standard representation is adopted according to the four types of general processes: electric engines, electrochemical processes, thermal processes and other processes. 

Energy consumption by households and commercial sector is determined by the most energy intensive categories of consumer needs, such as heating and cooling of dwellings, water heating, lighting, cooking, refrigerating, clothes washing and drying (ironing), dishwashing etc. 

The transport sector is represented by the types of transportation: road, railway, pipelines, aviation and navigation. The energy services, which are provided by technologies of road and rail transport, are transportation of passengers and freight.

The agriculture sector is divided into crop production, cattle breeding, local transport and other.

Energy system models, like TIMES-Ukraine, are usually applied for long-term analysis of energy system development pathways. By changing the assumptions on useful energy demands, technologies, prices or other exogenous variables, scenarios can be analysed. As a first step, scenarios without measures (baseline scenario) are developed. In the next step, policy scenarios are designed by imposing additional constraints or targets on the energy system as to assess the effect of different policies. The result of the modelling is an assessment of the least-cost solutions for the entire energy system under given conditions and restrictions.

The TIMES-Ukraine model satisfies the methodological recommendations of international organizations for the development of energy and environmental forecasts. In particular, the recommendations of the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change concerning the development of national communications [^11] 

Based on the previous applications, TIMES-Ukraine model is particularly suited to perform the following tasks:
- estimation of the optimal technological structure of the power system under the criterion of minimisation of the total discounted system cost [^12]
[^13]
[^14]
[^15]
- analysis of the structure of energy, material and financial flows in the system, taking into account resources trade [^16]
[^17]
[^18]
- assessment of the potential of energy savings, renewable energy sources, new types of energy and fuels, and investment prioritisation based on a least-cost optimisation [^19]
[^20]
[^21]
[^22]
- forecasting the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions [^23]
[^24]
[^25]
- identification of possible threats to the energy supply of the country and determination of measures for their prevention [^26]
[^27]
[^28]
- assessment of the impact of energy, economic, environmental, climate, industrial, agriculture, transport, innovation and other policies on energy development [^29]
- investigation of the advantages and risks of integration processes and international obligations in the energy, ecological, climate and other spheres [^30]
